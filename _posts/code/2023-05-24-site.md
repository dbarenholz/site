My personal site, which you are currently browsing, is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 
Jekyll is one of many _site generator (SG)_: it takes a bunch of files, in this case _markdown_ files, and then converts them to a HTML page.
The resulting HTML page can then be hosted virtually anywhere.

The reason why I am using a SG is because creating content in markdown is _easy_. 
It takes very little effort to make a site, and little maintenance.
To read more about the philosophy of Jekyll see its page on the [jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/) site.

Creating the site was fairly enjoyable.
While most things are supported by the theme I use, [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), the grid of posts on the [notes]({{ site.baseurl }}/notes) page is a bunch of custom stuff. 

From top to bottom, first are some buttons to filter on categories. These buttons are generated using [_Liquid_](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/) templating. All buttons are part of a main container, `button-group`, so I can use [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) for layouting. Each category gets its own button, which is by default `active`, and has a `data-filter` attribute that is used for filtering.

```html
{% raw %}<!-- Buttons to filter -->
<div class="button-group filter-button-group justify-content-center">
    {% for category in site.categories %}
        <a class="btn btn-sm btn-primary active" data-filter="{{ category[0] }}">{{ category[0] }}</a>
    {% endfor %}
</div>{% endraw %}
```
Below the buttons is the grid, which is also generated using [Liquid](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/): for each post I create a `post-item` that is shown by default (hence `post-shown`). At the bottom of the grid is a piece of text, identified by `#emptygrid`, that is hidden by default. This shows up if you filter out all posts.

```html
{% raw %}<!-- Grid -->
<div class="grid flex">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <div class="post-item post-shown {{ post.category }}">
            <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url }}">
                <h4>{{ post.title }}</h4>
            </a>
            <p> {{ post.excerpt | markdownify }}</p>
        </div>
    {% endfor %}
  <p id="emptygrid" style="display:none">You have filtered out all posts. It is empty now.</p>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

Filtering of these items is achieved through some JS.
First, grab the values that we can filter on.

```js
// Create a list of values that we filter on.
let filterValues = []
let elems = document.querySelectorAll('.filter-button-group a.active');
for (const elem of elems)
    // This grabs the data-filter attribute of the buttons made above.
    filterValues.push(elem.getAttribute("data-filter"))
```

Then, add an _event listener_ to all buttons. This event listener is the code that runs once you click on the button.

```js
// Loop over all the buttons
const buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.button-group a.btn')
for (const item of buttons) {
    // Define what happens when they are clicked
    item.addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
        // First, grab its data-filter attribute
        const value = item.getAttribute("data-filter")
        // Update its visibility.
        // If it was visible, hide it. If it was hidden, show it.
        updateVisibilityFor(value)

        // If the value to filter on was included in the list of values
        if (filterValues.includes(value)) {
            // Then we remove it from the values to filter on
            filterValues.splice( filterValues.indexOf(value), 1 )
            // And we toggle the active and inactive classes
            item.classList.toggle('active');
            item.classList.toggle('inactive');
        } else {
            // Otherwise, we add it back into the list of values to filter on
            filterValues.push(value)
            // And we toggle the active and inactive classes
            item.classList.toggle('active');
            item.classList.toggle('inactive');
        }

        // After all work is done, check if the grid has become empty.
        checkEmptyGrid()
    })
}
```

There are two helper functions. First, a helper function to update visibility of items. Notice that the `setTimeout()` is a **must**, and that its duration must be identical to the CSS animation duration. This is because of a [peculiarity when animating display properties](https://css-tricks.com/so-youd-like-to-animate-the-display-property/).

```js
function updateVisibilityFor(value) {
    // Select all DOM elements to toggle visibility for.
    const toggleMe = document.querySelectorAll(`.grid > div.${value}`)
    toggleMe.forEach((item) => {
        // If it is currently shown, then:
        if (item.classList.contains('post-shown')) {
            // SET A TIMEOUT to hide it. 
            // Note: The duration must be identical to the CSS animation duration
            setTimeout(() => {item.style.display = 'none'}, 200)
        }
        // If it is hidden, then:
        if (item.classList.contains('post-hidden')) {
            // show it (immediately).
            item.style.display = 'block'
        }

        // Always toggle the two classes indicating if it is shown or hidden
        item.classList.toggle('post-shown')
        item.classList.toggle('post-hidden')
    })
}
```

The second helper function is relatively simple: it checks if all items are hidden, and if so, it shows the piece of text indicated by `emptygrid`.

```js
function checkEmptyGrid() {
    // Grab all items in the grid
    const items = document.querySelectorAll(`.grid > div`)
    // Grab the piece of text you see when the grid is empty
    const text = document.querySelector('#emptygrid') 

    // Loop through all items in the grid
    let found = false;
    for (const item of items) {
        // If at least one of them is shown
        if (item.classList.contains('post-shown')) {
            // Then we don't have to do anything
            found = true
            break
        }
    }

    // Set the display style of the text accordingly
    text.style.display = !found ? 'unset' : 'none'
}
```

There are CSS animations on hiding and showing the items. This is achieved using following classes (CSS truncated to only relevant items). Note that the duration of _all_ the animations are `200 ms` -- this **must** be identical to the delay in `setTimeout()` when toggling visibility.

```css
.post-item {
    transition: all .2s ease;
}

.post-hidden {
    animation: hide .2s;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    display: block;
}

.post-shown {
    animation: show .2s;
    display: block;
}
```

The related keyframes are shown below. Note that for the `hide` animation there is a keyframe at 99% - this is again because of the [peculiarity when animating display properties](https://css-tricks.com/so-youd-like-to-animate-the-display-property/).

```css
@keyframes show {
    0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0);
    }

    100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
    }
}

@keyframes hide {
    0% {
        display: block;
        opacity: 1;
        transform: scale(1);
    }
    99% {
        display: block;
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0);
    }
    100% {
        display: none;
        opacity: 0;
        transform: scale(0);
    }
}
```
