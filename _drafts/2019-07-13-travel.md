An album titled _travel_, consisting of 3 pieces.
I envision this as a rather ambitious project, complete with music videos taken when travelling.
I started working on this project in 2019, when I went to Japan for the first time.

> **Current state**: 2 out of 3 pieces have a draft composition.

The 3 parts to travelling, corresponding with the 3 pieces themselves are:

1. **Departure**.
   This piece attempts to capture the feeling of "stress" or "the unknown",
   but also the "excitement" you have when starting something new.
   You are departing on a new journey, not knowing how long it will take, or what you may find on the way.
   It's an adventure!
2. **Journey**.
   This piece attempts to capture the "Hey, are we there yet?" you might hear when travelling with children.
   I see the journey as something relatively predictable, but sometimes there may be surprises that you then have to deal with.
3. **Arrival**.
   Finally, you arrive at your destination, whichever, whatever, or wherever that may be.
   The piece attempts to capture the feeling of "completeness" and "satisfaction", but
   also possible "tiredness" from the journey you have undertaken, and "sadness" because the journey itself is over.
