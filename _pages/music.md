In case you don't know me well enough: I love music.

I am currently privileged enough to take piano lessons from [Elena](https://www.pianoleseindhoven.nl/),
a wonderful human being with a seemingly infinite amount of musical wisdom.
As you can guess from the previous sentence, I very much enjoy the lessons.

> **Currently learning**:

> - Johann Sebastian Bach - 2 Part Invention No. 7 (Busoni). You can find a recording by Paul Barton [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVODyrh6cdc).

## Compositions

When I have time, I compose my own piano music. If/when I'm happy with the recording, I will upload it to Youtube.
For now, no recordings yet. If you want to get the latest updates on my music, the best place to do so is following my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dbarenholz).

### Plans

I have various plans for music that I want to create. You can read them here!

- An album titled _travel_, consisting of three (3) pieces.
  I envision this as a huge project, where I (or my good friend [Jakub](#)) film music videos that are taken when, well, travelling.
  The pieces themselves are:

  1. **Departure**.
     This piece attempts to capture the feeling of "stress" or "the unknown",
     but also the "excitement" you have when starting something new.
     You are departing on a new journey, not knowing how long it will take, or what you may find on the way. It's an adventure!
  2. **Commute**.
     This piece attempts to capture the "Hey, are we there yet?" you might hear when travelling with children.
     I see the commute as something relatively predictable, but sometimes there may be surprises that you then have to deal with.
  3. **Arrival**.
     Finally, you arrive at your destination, whichever, whatever, or wherever that may be.
     The piece attempts to capture the feeling of "completeness" and "satisfaction", but
     also possible "tiredness" from the journey you have undertaken, and "sadness" because the journey itself is over.

- An album titled _Sokkyou_, the romanized version of the Japanese word [_即興_](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%8D%B3%E8%88%88) meaning _improvisation_, _impromptu_. It will consist of all pieces that I recorded while improvising. These pieces are commonly around one (1) to two (2) minutes in length. Right now, there are five (5) <em>Sokkyou</em>s.

### Completed pieces

1. **At a glance**. (_no link yet_)
   A piece written in October 2015 when I was seventeen (17) years old.
   It's very simple, and mostly uses just two (2) types of chords progressions.
   Since it has been quite a while since I composed this, I don't have any backstory to it since I forgot.
   But, I still really like this piece.

2. **Eternity**. (_no link yet_)
   A piece written in November 2015 when I was seventeen (17) years old.
   Even though I don't remember any backstory to this piece, I find this to be very comfortable to listen to.

3. **Before the Storm**. (_no link yet_)
   The earliest composition that I, in my sixteen (16) year old wisdom, recorded on my phone in 2014.
   It's a fairly simple piece, written when I couldn't play piano that well.
   Since it has been quite a while since I composed this, I don't have any backstory to it since I forgot.

## Repertoire

Below is a list of pieces that I feel somewhat comfortable performing, in order of when I learned to play them.
