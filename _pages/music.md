In case you do not know me well enough yet: I love music.

I have been privileged enough to take piano lessons from [Elena](https://www.pianoleseindhoven.nl/),
an amazing human being with a seemingly infinite amount of musical wisdom. I have very much enjoyed those lessons, and am now adventuring the wonderful world of music on my own.

> **Currently learning**:
>
> - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart - Sonate C Major K. 309, 1st movement. You can find a recording by Mitsuko Uchida [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QgT4_e8PTg).
> - Hania Rani - Eden. You can find a recording by Hania Rani [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R1vOdO0Gwk).

## Compositions

When I have time, I compose my own piano music. When I am happy with the recording, I will upload it to Youtube.
Information about the current state of my compositions can be found in my [notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) -- filter so you only see music related notes.

## Repertoire

Below is a list of pieces that I feel (somewhat) comfortable performing, in order of when I learned to play them.
The latests pieces are at the top of the list.
If I have a recording of a particular piece available, you can click on the name to open it.
