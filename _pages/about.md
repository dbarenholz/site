I am an innovation-driven, hardworking person, always looking to improve. It does not matter if it is a new technological framework or developing an improvement upon existing code, I am always up for the task if I can learn something. For a slightly more professional (and complete) explanation of who I am, visit [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarenholz/).

## Experience

**Current**:

- I am currently doing my graduation project at [Vanderlande](https://www.vanderlande.com/). I can't get into too much detail, but rest assured that it's really cool! When done, you can download the thesis [here](#).

- I am in the final stages of my internship at the [Process Analytics](https://pa.win.tue.nl/) group, where I'm looking at process discovery and probabilistic models, and how to (possibly) combine those two fields. When done, you can download the report [here](#).

**Previous**:

- I volunteered at [Together with Classical](https://www.togetherwithclassical.org/), a charity, founded by [Tiffany Poon](https://www.tiffanypoon.com/), arguably my favourite classical pianist. It stands for bringing classical music closer to people, which is something that I, too, really care about.

- During my [education](#education) I have been a teaching assistant (TA) for various courses. As a TA, I was responsible for, amongst other things, explaining course material in a clear and concise fashion, as well as grading (and sometimes even making) assignments.

- In the academic year 2017-2018 I was the secretary of my local Japanese culture association [JCES Kinjin](https://kinjin.nl/). This was a load of fun, and I can highly recommend anyone do a board year at your favourite culture/study/sport association.

- I worked on a front-end for a companyâ€™s internal inventory management system using [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui). As it is internal, I sadly can't share the results. If you're curious about my coding skills, check out my [github](https://github.com/dbarenholz).

## Education

**Current**:

- I am currently pursuing a masters degree titled **Data Science in Engineering** at Eindhoven University of Technology. During my masters my focus lays on **process mining** and **deep generative models**, two topics I find highly interesting. If you're curious about either of these topics (or anything else computer science related), don't hesite to [contact](https://dbarenholz.com/contact) me!

**Previous**:

- In 2019 I obtained a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. During said bachelor, I was enrolled in the Honors Programme doing competitive programming and problem solving. I very thoroughly enjoyed the seminar part of the Honors Programme, where students had to present a particular topic of choice. My topic was _subset dynamic programming_. Curious?
