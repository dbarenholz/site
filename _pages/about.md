I am an innovation-driven, hardworking person, always looking to improve.
It does not matter if it is a new technological framework or developing an improvement upon existing code, I am always up for the task if I can learn something.
For a slightly more professional (and complete) explanation of who I am, visit [my linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarenholz/).

## Current position

- I am currently doing a PhD at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/staff/dbarenholz) on the interplay between processes and data.
  See my [research]({{ site.url }}/research) page for more information about the topic, my publications, and my teaching tasks.

## My Education

- **Masters**: I have a Master of Science titled _Data Science in Engineering_.
  This is a specialised mastertrack within Computer Science offered by Eindhoven University of Technology.
  During my masters I focused on _process mining_ and _deep generative models_, two topics I find highly interesting.
  I was a teaching assistant for various courses during my master.

- **Bachelors**: I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, obtained from the same university.
  During my bachelors I did not focus on a particular topic; in stead I took a variety of different courses to broaden my horizon.
  I was a teaching assistant for various courses during my bachelor.

- **Extracurricular: Honors Programme**: During my bachelor I was enrolled in the _honors programme_ doing competitive programming and problem solving.
  My (rather old) cheatsheet is [here]({{ site.url }}/_assets/docs/honors/cheatsheet.docx).
  As part of the honors programme I gave a talk on _subset dynamic proggramming_.
  The slides are [here]({{ site.url }}/_assets/docs/honors/slides.pptx), and the report is [here]({{ site.url }}/_assets/docs/honors/report.pdf).

## Experience

- I have done my graduation project at [Vanderlande](https://www.vanderlande.com/).
  At Vanderlande I worked on improving their _STOREPICK_ evolution.
  The project was exploratory in nature: it was unclear if a data-driven approach to improvement was possible.
  The (public) thesis can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/_assets/docs/thesis/thesis.pdf).

- I have done my internship at the [Process Analytics](https://pa.win.tue.nl/) group in Eindhoven.
  During the internship I looked at how we could potentially combine the fields of process discovery and probabilistic models.
  The (public) report can be found [here]({{ site.url }}/_assets/docs/internship_pa/report.pdf).

- I have worked on an undisclosed company's inventory management system using [Kendo UI](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) and PHP.
  During my time there, I was mostly bughunting the existing codebase and fixing errors.

## Volunteering

- Although for a short period, I volunteered at [Together with Classical](https://www.togetherwithclassical.org/), a charity that stands for bringing classical music closer to people.

- During my bachelors, in the academic year 2017-2018, I was the secretary of Japanese culture association [JCES Kinjin](https://kinjin.nl/).
