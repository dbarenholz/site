I have my own server (it really is just another computer running ubuntu-server), and host my own services. 
This is a hobby of mine, and is always a work in progress.
In the table below you can find the list of services I eventually want to run.
If there is a link, then it is running; otherwise it is still on my todolist.
Feel free to contact me if you have questions about how I host these services with `docker-compose`.

| Service                                                         | Usage                                  | Link                                           |
