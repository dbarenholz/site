<h1> Hello, world!</h1>

Hey there, and welcome to my little corner of the internet!
My name is DaniÃ«l Barenholz, and I am a 25 year old PhD candidate at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/staff/dbarenholz).
While interested in many things, my research topic is the interplay between processes and data.
If you want to learn more, I probably have some [notes]({{ site.url }}/notes) on the topic.
For my academic publications, head to [research]({{ site.url}}/research).
Looking for a more professional way of introducing myself?
Go to the [about]({{ site.url }}/about) section.

Besides working, I can often be found behind my piano.
I truly love [music]({{ site.url}}/music), from listening to it to trying to transcribe and to arrange.
Once in a blue moon I may also [code](https://github.com/dbarenholz) some tools, either for a community or for myself.
I also have my own [server]({{ site.url }}/server) with a bunch of fun tools running.

Questions? Want to talk? See a mistake somewhere?
You absolutely must talk to me about a super cool experience you have had?
[Get in touch with me]({{ site.url }}/contact).
