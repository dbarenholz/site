An album titled _Sokkyou_, the romanized version of the Japanese word [_即興_](https://jisho.org/word/%E5%8D%B3%E8%88%88) meaning _improvisation_, _impromptu_. It will consist of all pieces that I recorded while improvising. These pieces are commonly around one (1) to two (2) minutes in length. Right now, there are five (5) <em>Sokkyou</em>s.
